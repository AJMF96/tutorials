= Tutorial for Cobigen Setup
====
CobiGen is a generic incremental code generator. It allows you to build Java CRUD application based on the devonfw architecture including all software layers. You can generate all necessary classes and services (DAOs, Transfer Objects, simple CRUD use cases with REST services) of the application from one single entity class.

Here in this tutorial we will learn how we can set up the CobiGen environment in our system along with eclipse and maven integration. 

Cobigen provides eclipse and maven integration. There is command line interface(CLI) through which we can proceed with integration.

== Prerequisites
Before we start, the installation of devinfw ide is already done for you.

[step]
--
restoreDevonfwIde(["java","mvn"], "2020.08.001")
--

Now we will proceed with CobiGen installation.
[step]
--
installCobiGen()
--
====
Below are the commands which we can use on CobiGen CLI.
Using the following command and option you will be able to customize your generation as follows
[step]

nextKatacodaStep("Commands and Options", [{ "file": "files/commandsAndOptions.md" }])
--
====
In order to execute the commands we will have to initialize the CobiGen CLI first.

[step]
--
nextKatacodaStep("CLI Execution steps", [{ "file": "files/cliExecutionCommands.md" }])
--
====
To resolve the errors caused by generation some extra files we will do troubleshooting in CLI.

[step]
--
nextKatacodaStep("Troubleshooting in CLI", [{ "file": "files/cliTroubleshooting.md" }])
--

Now in the next we will see how to integrate CobiGen in eclipse.
====

In this step we will learn about how we can integrate CobiGen in eclipse.
[step]
--
nextKatacodaStep("Eclipse Integration", [{ "file": "files/eclipseIntegration.md" }])
--

After installation we will go through the modes of usage of CobiGen.
====
In this step we will learn about the types of modes for usage of CobiGen.
[step]
--
nextKatacodaStep("Usage mode of CobiGen in eclipse", [{ "file": "files/cobigenUsageMode.md" }])
--

Now you know how to use CobiGen in a particular project.
However there can be some error while using cobigen. There are times where the selected command don't run as per requirement so for that we do health check for CobiGen templates.
[step]
--
nextKatacodaStep("CobiGen Health Check", [{ "file": "files/cobigenHealthCheck.md" }])
