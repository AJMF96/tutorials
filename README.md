**Tutorials**

Welcome to the devonfw tutorials repository.

In this repository, you write tutorials that are executed by the tutorial compiler (https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler). The tutorial compiler ensures that the tutorials are automatically tested end-to-end. It also generates other output, such as full Katacoda tutorials.<br/>

You can find devonfw Katacoda tutorials at https://katacoda.com/devonfw.<br/>

You can find an explanation how you can create your own tutorials on the development section.<br/>
[Development](https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development)<br>
There is also a tutorial showing the process of creating a turorial on the devonfw katacoda account (https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/tutorial-compiler).

An overview of the commands included in the tutorial compiler can be found in the function overview. You can use these commands in your own created tutorials.<br/>
